# Converter class

The idea was to use ether as a base so whatever unit from it will be converter to ether as a base and then converted to whatever conversion unit.

FROM --> ether --> TO

The json object was created with the idea of get rid of the zeros via the exponential property. In that way we can deal with the conversion in an easier way.



The following cases were implemented to make the conversion. See methods evluateFrom, evaluateTo

| From/To       | currency            | ether               | unit                |
| ------------- |:-------------------:| -------------------:|--------------------:|
| currency      | x                   | fromCurrencyToEther | fromCurrencyToEther - fromEtherToUnits |
| ether         | fromEtherToCurrency | x                   | fromEtherToUnits    |
| unit          | fromUnitsToEther - fromEtherToCurrency  | fromUnitsToEther    | fromUnitsToEther - fromEtherToUnits   |

## Issues

Unfortunately, the converter has some known issues:

- Better validations for numbers.
- The requested swicth functionality is missing.
